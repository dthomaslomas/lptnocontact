<p class="bold">Brett Lomas has been involved in the electrical industry for over 35 years, gaining a wealth of knowledge and experience. Having seen some very dangerous and shocking things (pardon the pun) in and around the work place during his time contracting, he has now decided to dedicate his business solely to Portable Appliance Testing.</p>
<p>At Lomas Portable Appliance Testing we aim to be unique by offering you a range of fantastic easy to understand loyalty packages and a free on site survey.</p>
<p class="bold">100% guarantee that the quote you are given is the price you pay, no nasty little add ons.</p>
<p class="bold">100% guaranteed customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="bold">100% guaranteed loyalty.</p>
<p>There is no room for compromise where electrical safety is concerned.</p>
<p>We believe it is important to have an initial free site survey because this allows us to inform and advise you of any problems that can be rectified (by yourselves if preferred). Having these problems rectified before the date of testing will save you ££££s in the long run. We can then put into place a testing program to suit your business needs, offering you an ongoing and very high level of service.</p>
<p>Please feel free to call if you have any questions, we are here to help you and your business in any way we can.</p>
<p>All our engineers are City and Guilds qualified and the company has a £5 million public liability policy in place. All our testing equipment incorporates only the latest technology, software and up to date calibration certificates.</p>
<p>Did you know your insurance premiums might be lower if you have an annual PAT testing program in place? Also PAT testing is classified as maintenance and repair so that makes it fully tax deductible.</p>
<p>Please remember you are the customer and we are here to work around your needs, and to offer you the most cost effective PAT testing program to suit your requirements.</p>
<p class="bold">WE TEST YOU REST – ASSURED</p>
